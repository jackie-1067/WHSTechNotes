The BOLT: Compass is one of the sensors we have gone over in the lesson of today. This sensor works to measure direction as it helps the BOLT Sphere figure out where North, East, South, and West is. The sensor uses the spheres magnetic forces of the Earth to calculate and rotate the matrix shown towards that direction. For example, if the direction is North and the matrix animation is an arrow, the Sphero BOLT will show the arrow facing North. This sensor can be used in many activities or challanges as you can create a treasure hunt, like in the lesson, or use the function as an actual compass to figure out which way you are facing and which way to go.
