The BOLT: Compass is one of the sensors we have gone over in the lesson of today. This sensor works to measure direction as it helps the BOLT Sphere figure out where North, East, South, and West is. The sensor uses the spheres magnetic forces of the Earth to calculate and rotate the matrix shown towards that direction. For example, if the direction is North and the matrix animation is an arrow, the Sphero BOLT will show the arrow facing North. This sensor can be used in many activities or challanges as you can create a treasure hunt, like in the lesson, or use the function as an actual compass to figure out which way you are facing and which way to go.

For Me: The instructions weren't as confusing, but there were some steps that had me confused on what to do so I had to ask help. I would say that having the whole class do it together as a group would be better because we would avoid doing the wrong things and students can ask help as we do it to better understand the intsructions.
For You: I did encounter a challenge while following the steps. I did not understand why I had created a folder instead of a file. I believe I read the instructions incorrectly or misunderstood what they had been telling me to do. Thankfully I was able to ask for guidance and I fixed my error.

Ease of Use: I find python easier to understand than the Sphero block coding because the instructions are more straight forward and direct. Problem-Solving: The two approaches helped me solve coding challenges by providing the codes I needed to use, we only had to put them in order based on what we wanted the program to do. Flexibility: I feel that I have more freedom in python than in Sphero because as long as we know and write the commands correctly, we can program anything we want, but in Sphero, we are limited to the blocks they have available and nothing else. Real-World Application: Python programming might be more useful compared to block coding because with python we can create many different things such as games, websites, analysis, etc. since block coding, based on what I have seen, works more for robotics, game development, and story telling.

One task or process where computer science plays a role in my daily routines or activities is in the websites I use. Computer science is used to create many things such as websites, games, and other types of apps. It impacts my life greatly as I use technology everyday. I usually play games, watch shows, or do my homework on websites/apps that were created using computer science. Workplaces and schools also use this technology for efficiency. Without computer science, our lives would have a great change. Things like advanced communication around the world, entertainment, machinery, and websites wouldn't exist at all without computer science. Life without it would be like in older times where we would have to go through longer processes just to achieve something. For example, we would have to write physical letters in order to send out messages and wait a long time until the other person recieves the message. With computer science though, we have messenger apps that allow you to send a message that the other person instantly recieves and is able to answer at that moment. This is why computer science has done a great impact on our daily lives.

As years have gone by, coding has helped create many helpful systems and mechanics, but, how do these skills help one in any industry? Coding can improve problem solving skills by allowing you to learn how to breakdown complex problenms into smaller ones as well as helping you think logically, create solutions, test, and once you solve the problem, you can reflect and learn from that experience. Understanding code can help you in industries that aren't directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education because it can make things more efficient for you. For example, in the video we watched, the doctor was able to use a sequencer to analyze spit from a patient or another substance to diagnose the patien in just an hour. This was possible due to coding and computer science since they are able to download data of previous viruses and diseases and find what they need to classify the disease the patient has. Furthermore, coding enhances creativity and collaboration as you can create anything you want and have multiple people test your work, help you work on it, and give you feedback. For example you can create a website with your own preferences and themes while other people can help you review the website to see if it is working or put your minds together to make many themes and functions to make the site look and work better. We can also look at another example such as Amazon, a site and app where one can do shopping online, was made with coding and in the industry, there are machines that help organize shipping which are also programmed to do that with coding. This is why coding is valuable knowledge as it is used in many industries and can make work more efficient no matter what industry you are in or are interested in.

Artificial Intelligence is something that has been taking over and has done both good and bad things to society and workplaces. To start with, AI has given us opportunities to make learning, working, healthcare, and transportation more efficient and innovating. AI can help with solving complex problems that one may find overwhelming to understand and by using AI, they can get a simplified explanation which can help them understand and learn more. Furthermore, it is beneficial for multiple people that need assistance in their homes or workplaces. Industries are more efficient with harder, dangerous jobs with the help of robots as they can quickly and accurately do their jobs and can easily be fixed if an accident occurs. It also organizes data and solves problems that we can't solve on our own. If we pair artificial intelligence with our own work, we can produce stronger, higher quality material.
Although, AI has its benefits, it also has its downfalls. Some of these negatives include innaccurate results due to biased inputs by the creators of the system. AI is also not original and it takes work from others and combines it to give us what we are looking for. This looks bad in industries because it leaves people uncredited for the work that they do and many end up losing their jobs to these machines. In addition, it does not allow us to think nor become creative as we have begun to heavily rely on AI. For example, students use AI to do their work and do not put any effort in learning the material. Privacy isn't entirely secured because as we know, AI is always learning, so whatever we input online, it takes to upgrade its knowledge. Since AI is technology and technology isn't perfect yet, they can have many malfunctions along the way that can lead to accidents, false information, and bias. In conclusion, artificial intelligence is helpful as it helps industries and society work more efficiently, but, it all depends on the usage.

Computer science and technology impact the election process by making things more efficient but at the same time it can cause security problems and many arguments online. One positive impact of technology playing a role in the elections is that the votes can be efficiently and accurately counted and data can be produced out of the information it collects. Another positive aspect is that many people can stay informed about the elections and about the candidates in order to make a good election choice which will benefit the country and community as a whole. One potential concern is that the system the technology counting the votes is operating in can be hacked. This can cause the votes to be changed and a false result to be displayed to the public. False results can cause a big problem to the public as many will argue about them, some believing they are true and others trying to prove they are false which can then turn into a huge and dangerous dilema. This can relate to another concern of technology taking a role in elections since people or politics can uses computer science to create false information which can infulence many people online to either believe or fight against it. As stated before, this can cause a huge dilema in the public as many opinions and perspectives will be produced and in the outside public, there can be dangerous arguments that can escalate to actual physical fighting which is a great concern for the community.

Whenever we post or share content online, there are many kinds or information about yourself and others that are being published for the whole public to view. Althougth people may think there is no harm in doing so, we must still protect our information. It is important to protect personal and sensitive information when publishing online because there can be people who can use it to do bad things such as scamming, cyber-bullied, steal your identity, take credit card information, and lots more. This is something we really do not want as it can ruin our lives forever and can be hard to fix. Some steps I can take to ensure that the information I share on platfroms like GitHub or social media remains secure is by making sure you use strong, secure passwords, not sharing any unecessary information such as age, home address, and family members. Of course, there are other methods such as setting up a two-step vertification when logging in to a website, not reusing passwords, and not openly sharing information to others. In my life, I never really shared any personal information as I have always been taught not to befriend strangers online and tell them things like my age and real name online. I have also been taught not to share other information such as passwords and my address. Though, I have seen this happen to other people who later regretted this. One can balance being open and collaborative in online spaces while still protecting your privacy by keeping your personal life and information outside of the workplace. By doing this, you won't risk oversharing and potentially being harmed online. This is why it is important to protect personal and sensitive information when publishing things online.

A current event that impacts my community is the elections. As we all know, many citizens went out to vote for the president of their choice. Some did this through mail, and some through polls. Many of these votes are all counted by a computer that is programmed to specifically and accurately count these votes and categorize who they voted for. This is where technology takes an important role as it is analyzing all this information which will determine the future of our country. Although this is a very efficient method, there has been a case where votes have been dismissed and not counted for due to whatever reason. One of these reasons, though it may not have been, could have been the systems failure, or someone hacked into the system and messed with the votes. These types of problems can be fixed in the future as technology advances.
Although, there are many possible reasons as to why some votes may have been dismissed, we know that if we make advances in technology, system failures or hackers messing with the elections will be less likely. Systems can be strengthend in order to avoid anyone from interfering with the votes, which is very important. Additionally, advanced technology can help keep the voters safe and protected by keeping their personal information safe once they cast their vote. Furthermore, updates will be more accurately presented to the public which can also help with stopping fake rumors about people cheating. Overall, advancement in technology can help in preventing issues similar or just like this one which would be a great benefit for everyone and help our minds grow.

Technology has made big differences during the holiday seasons when it comes to purchasing items such as food. These differences has made it possible for food to become more affordable and accessible duing the holidy season by making it easier to find and purchase and using discounts to make it more affordable. For example, if you have an app such as Walmart, you can make your shopping through your device and order it for delivery or pick up which makes it easier to get other things ready for the season since you wont be wasting time looking around the store for the items you need. Furthermore, you can use online discounts and apply them before finalizing the purchase in order to save money. Of course, this does not only apply to grocery shopping but also buying fast food. There are many apps one can download and order online from. These apps can include companies such as McDonalds, Whataburger, etc. They offer rewards which you can use to recieve an item for free or with a discount which makes it affordable. In addition, they also provide pick up or delivery services which makes it more efficient. This is what technology has done to make things morre efficient and accessible for us during the holidays, but like all good inventions, there is a negative side to this. Many people can become lazy and dependable on these apps to do their shopping at. For example, someone can order food online every single day without having to do anything which can reduce physical activity and social interactions which are both two important factors our bodies need. We also lose the ability to figure out what produce is ripe or how to maneuver around shops since we wouldn't be used to doing this anymore. Therefore, I believe its good to balance using technology to purchase food and physically going to buy in order to benefit from the innovation and not lose our skills and activity.

One recent development in technology is the tesla robot which was made by Tesla in around 2021 but has made recent developments and upgrades. This robot was made to do basic tasks such as moving objects, navigating , and recognizing its environment. This robot was also made to "walk among people" which means it can babysit, teach, walk dogs, serve drinks, etc. I believe our society and daily lives can be impacted in a negative way as we will become lazier to do some of the easiest tasks in our lives as well as decline our health as we would'nt recieve the necessary amount of exercise or movement one needs in a daily basis since we have the robots to do the jobs for us. My future career isn't as impacted as other careers that might switch up from human employees to robot employees, but it still can be dangerous as robots have massive intelligence and can basically do anything they desire without limits. What excites me about this advancement is that we are finding ways to make our lives more efficient to be able to take advantage of the time we gain from the robots doing our basic chores/work, but as my concern, it is becoming lazier and dumber as the days pass. An innovative way this technology could be used in my field of interest. which is Computer Science, is that we can find ways to continue programming the robot to do greater stuff and find ways to improve it to accomodate the lives of the people who purchase them. Some ethical considerations that might need to be addressed as this technology evolves is privacy. Anyone, if they know how, can access the information the robot has collected, including its producer which can be a concen to many people as they have important and private information that they do not want to share but this robot can easily access it using its intelligence and technology it has been given. The sources I used to find my information are theweek.com and builtin.com.
