Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

The BOLT: Compass is one of the sensors we have gone over in the lesson of today. This sensor works to measure direction as it helps the BOLT Sphere figure out where North, East, South, and West is. The sensor uses the spheres magnetic forces of the Earth to calculate and rotate the matrix shown towards that direction. For example, if the direction is North and the matrix animation is an arrow, the Sphero BOLT will show the arrow facing North. This sensor can be used in many activities or challanges as you can create a treasure hunt, like in the lesson, or use the function as an actual compass to figure out which way you are facing and which way to go.

For Me: The instructions weren't as confusing, but there were some steps that had me confused on what to do so I had to ask help. I would say that having the whole class do it together as a group would be better because we would avoid doing the wrong things and students can ask help as we do it to better understand the intsructions.
For You: I did encounter a challenge while following the steps. I did not understand why I had created a folder instead of a file. I believe I read the instructions incorrectly or misunderstood what they had been telling me to do. Thankfully I was able to ask for guidance and I fixed my error.

Ease of Use: I find python easier to understand than the Sphero block coding because the instructions are more straight forward and direct. Problem-Solving: The two approaches helped me solve coding challenges by providing the codes I needed to use, we only had to put them in order based on what we wanted the program to do. Flexibility: I feel that I have more freedom in python than in Sphero because as long as we know and write the commands correctly, we can program anything we want, but in Sphero, we are limited to the blocks they have available and nothing else. Real-World Application: Python programming might be more useful compared to block coding because with python we can create many different things such as games, websites, analysis, etc. since block coding, based on what I have seen, works more for robotics, game development, and story telling.

One task or process where computer science plays a role in my daily routines or activities is in the websites I use. Computer science is used to create many things such as websites, games, and other types of apps. It impacts my life greatly as I use technology everyday. I usually play games, watch shows, or do my homework on websites/apps that were created using computer science. Workplaces and schools also use this technology for efficiency. Without computer science, our lives would have a great change. Things like advanced communication around the world, entertainment, machinery, and websites wouldn't exist at all without computer science. Life without it would be like in older times where we would have to go through longer processes just to achieve something. For example, we would have to write physical letters in order to send out messages and wait a long time until the other person recieves the message. With computer science though, we have messenger apps that allow you to send a message that the other person instantly recieves and is able to answer at that moment. This is why computer science has done a great impact on our daily lives.

Job Title: Software Engineer
Job Description: The main responsibilities of this role is to design, develop, and test software applications by writing code, debugging issues, analyzing requirements, etc.
Skills Required: Programming, Problem-solving, Communication, Organizational skills, Teamwork, Database, and Data structures and algorithms.
Education and Experience: A bachelor's degree in the computer science or software engineering fields, coding experience, and continuous learning are some experiences and educations that are typically needed for this role.
Career Growth: Some opportunities for growth or advancements in this career are the abilities to learn how to develop software to protect against cyber threats, develop proficieny in relevent programming languages and tools, certifications, and many, many more.
Reflection: I have been interested in software engineering as I believe it plays a big role in the technological advances that have been made throughout the years. This job aligns with my interests and goals in computer science since the job literally revolves around computer science, a subject I enjoy learning about. To achieve this, I need to learn how to write, read, debug code, and much more which is what I am learning in this class.

As years have gone by, coding has helped create many helpful systems and mechanics, but, how do these skills help one in any industry? Coding can improve problem solving skills by allowing you to learn how to breakdown complex problenms into smaller ones as well as helping you think logically, create solutions, test, and once you solve the problem, you can reflect and learn from that experience. Understanding code can help you in industries that aren't directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education because it can make things more efficient for you. For example, in the video we watched, the doctor was able to use a sequencer to analyze spit from a patient or another substance to diagnose the patien in just an hour. This was possible due to coding and computer science since they are able to download data of previous viruses and diseases and find what they need to classify the disease the patient has. Furthermore, coding enhances creativity and collaboration as you can create anything you want and have multiple people test your work, help you work on it, and give you feedback. For example you can create a website with your own preferences and themes while other people can help you review the website to see if it is working or put your minds together to make many themes and functions to make the site look and work better. We can also look at another example such as Amazon, a site and app where one can do shopping online, was made with coding and in the industry, there are machines that help organize shipping which are also programmed to do that with coding. This is why coding is valuable knowledge as it is used in many industries and can make work more efficient no matter what industry you are in or are interested in.
