Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

The BOLT: Compass is one of the sensors we have gone over in the lesson of today. This sensor works to measure direction as it helps the BOLT Sphere figure out where North, East, South, and West is. The sensor uses the spheres magnetic forces of the Earth to calculate and rotate the matrix shown towards that direction. For example, if the direction is North and the matrix animation is an arrow, the Sphero BOLT will show the arrow facing North. This sensor can be used in many activities or challanges as you can create a treasure hunt, like in the lesson, or use the function as an actual compass to figure out which way you are facing and which way to go.

For Me: The instructions weren't as confusing, but there were some steps that had me confused on what to do so I had to ask help. I would say that having the whole class do it together as a group would be better because we would avoid doing the wrong things and students can ask help as we do it to better understand the intsructions.
For You: I did encounter a challenge while following the steps. I did not understand why I had created a folder instead of a file. I believe I read the instructions incorrectly or misunderstood what they had been telling me to do. Thankfully I was able to ask for guidance and I fixed my error.

Ease of Use: I find python easier to understand than the Sphero block coding because the instructions are more straight forward and direct. Problem-Solving: The two approaches helped me solve coding challenges by providing the codes I needed to use, we only had to put them in order based on what we wanted the program to do. Flexibility: I feel that I have more freedom in python than in Sphero because as long as we know and write the commands correctly, we can program anything we want, but in Sphero, we are limited to the blocks they have available and nothing else. Real-World Application: Python programming might be more useful compared to block coding because with python we can create many different things such as games, websites, analysis, etc. since block coding, based on what I have seen, works more for robotics, game development, and story telling.
